## About The Project

This project is build as a part of flexmoney assessment. I have designed a form which accepts details of a user and register them for yoga classes. After registration is completed I have added a feature of dummy payment which is basically a form accepting certain details and storing the details. So if user wants to register for yoga classes he can register for classes anyday of a month and for exactly one month. Also if user wants he/she can change the batch timings for next month while registering.
